# Clinic Management

To start project:
1) clone or download project from git;
2) cd to folder;
3) npm i;
4) npm start;


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
